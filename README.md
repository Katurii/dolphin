## Introduction

SODA Infrastructure Manager is an open source project to provides unified, intelligent and scalable resource management, alert and performance monitoring. It will cover the resource management of all the storage backends & other infrastructures under SODA deployment. It will also provide the alert management and metric data(performance/health) for monitoring and further analysis. It will provide a scalable framework where more and more backends and also client exporters can be added. This will enable to add more storage and infrastructure backends, also support different management clients for monitoring and health prediction.

It provides unified APIs to access, export and connect with clients as well as a set if interfaces for various driver addition.

This is one of the SODA Core Projects and is maintained by SODA Foundation directly.
